Assess a question and its answer to see if the answer is a valid response and label it 'yes' or 'no'. Output 'yes' if the answer answers the question and output 'no' if the answer does not answer the question. Ensure that the answer is not only relevant but also sufficient to fully address the question. Now complete the question: Question: Do repeated balloon inflations diminish ST segment elevation even though coronary collateral recruitment is promoted in pigs?Answer: Repeated BIs do not diminish ST segment elevation in the pig model, even though coronary collateral recruitment is promoted.<\/Directive>\n<Additional Information>Ensure that the answer is not only relevant but also sufficient to fully address the question.<\/Additional Information>\n<Output Formatting>Assess a question and its answer to see if the answer is a valid response and label it 'yes' or 'no'. Output 'yes' if the answer answers the question and output 'no' if the answer does not answer the question.<\/Output Formatting>\n<Examples>Here are some examples: Positive Example 1 - Input: Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?Answer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS.ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response.The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.Output: yes Positive Example 2 - Input: Question: Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?Answer: Neuronal signals via the hepatic vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and protection against obesity in HFD fed Pemt(-\/-) mice.Output: yes Negative Example 1 - Input: Question: Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?Answer: We identified a novel biologically plausible candidate (FGFR2) for with BWC that merits further study.Output: no Negative Example 2 - Input: Question: Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?Answer: Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting).Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.Output: no.<\/Examples>",
